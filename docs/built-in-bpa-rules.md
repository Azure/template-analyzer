## Service Fabric clusters should only use Azure Active Directory for client authentication
Service Fabric clusters should only use Azure Active Directory for client authentication. A Service Fabric cluster offers several entry points to its management functionality, including the web-based Service Fabric Explorer, Visual Studio and PowerShell. Access to the cluster must be controlled using AAD.

**Recommendation**: [Enable AAD client authentication on your Service Fabric clusters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-creation-setup-aad)
