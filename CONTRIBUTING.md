# Contributing to the ARM Template BPA
We welcome community contributions to the Template BPA. Please note that by participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) and terms of the [CLA](#contributor-license-agreement-cla).

## Getting Started
* If you haven't already, you will need the [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed locally to build and run this project.
* Fork this repo (see [this forking guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more information).
* Checkout the repo locally with `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/template-analyzer.git`.
* The .NET solution can be built with the `dotnet build` command.
 
## Developing

### Environment
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) is a great way to get started.
  * Start VS Code and open the root directory where the code is cloned locally (File->Open Folder...).
* Run the `build` task (Terminal->Run Task...->build) in VS Code to build the Template BPA.
* Try analyzing a template: open a template file in VS Code and then run the `Launch CLI on Template` launch configuration (Run->Start Debugging).
  * Alternatively, modify the configuration in [launch.json](./.vs/launch.json) and specify a path to a template file, and optionally specify a path to a parameters file to use.
  * Additionally, the `Launch CLI on Directory` launch configuration analyzes the directory of the open file in VS Code. 

### Components
The Template Analyzer solution is comprised of the following main components:
* CLI (*[src\Analyzer.Cli](./src/Analyzer.Cli)*): The command-line tool to execute the Template BPA. This executable will pass template files to Analyzer.Core.
* Core (*[src\Analyzer.Core](./src/Analyzer.Core)*): The main Analyzer library which executes all rule engines against provided templates.
  * BuiltInRules.json (*[src\Analyzer.Core\Rules\BuiltInRules.json](./src/Analyzer.Core/Rules/BuiltInRules.json)*): The file with the built-in Template BPA rules.
* Template Processor (*[src\Analyzer.TemplateProcessor](./src/Analyzer.TemplateProcessor)*): This library parses ARM templates and evaluates expressions found in the template.
* JSON Rule Engine (*[src\Analyzer.JsonRuleEngine](./src/Analyzer.JsonRuleEngine)*): The library dedicated to parse and evaluate the Template BPA JSON rules.

### NuGet Packages
* There are two .nuspec files that define NuGet packages that can be created
  * [src\Analyzer.Core.NuGet\Analyzer.Core.nuspec](./src/Analyzer.Core.NuGet/Analyzer.Core.nuspec) for packing Analyzer.Core into package *Azure.Templates.Analyzer.Core*.
  * [src\Analyzer.Cli.NuGet\Analyzer.Cli.nuspec](./src/Analyzer.Cli.NuGet/Analyzer.Cli.nuspec) for packing Analyzer.Cli into package *Azure.Templates.Analyzer.CommandLine*.
* These can be packed (after building the solution) using the [nuget.exe CLI](https://www.nuget.org/downloads)
  * Example: `nuget pack <nuspec-file> -p Configuration=<Debug|Release>`
  * Use `Debug` or `Release` depending on the Configuration the solution or projects were built with
  * This is a great way to test NuGet consumption of local changes
 
### Code Structure
1. Analyzer CLI (or another calling application) identifies JSON files (template and parameter files) and invokes Analyzer.Core.
2. Analyzer Core calls the Template Processing Library to process the template and (if supplied) the provided parameters. The Template Processing Library processes all the template functions.
3. Analyzer Core then calls the JSON Rule Engine and evaluates each rule against the template/parameter pairs.
4. JSON Rule Engine evaluates the expressions specified in the `evaluation` section of the rule and generates results to identify the rule violation in the template.
 
### Running the Tests
* Use the `dotnet test` command to run the full Template BPA test suite.
* If using VS Code, run the tests with the `test` task (Terminal->Run Task...->test).

### Contributing Analyzer Rules
Review the [Authoring JSON Rules](./docs/authoring-json-rules.md) section to write new built-in Template BPA rules. Information on the new rules would also have to be added in [Built-in BPA Rules](./docs/built-in-bpa-rules.md), in alphabetical order. Thorough tests are required as well, documentation on how to use the framework for testing rules can be found [here](./src/Analyzer.Core.BuiltInRuleTests/README.md).

### Coding Conventions

#### Code
Please follow the below conventions when contributing to this project.
* Using directives:
  * Should be listed alphabetically by namespace
  * `System.*` namespaces should be listed first
  * Namespaces can be grouped by top-level name, but should be alphabetical within the group
* Follow the below naming conventions:

    | Components | Casing |
    | --- | --- |
    | Class names, properties, and methods | *PascalCase* |
    | Private class variables | *camelCase* |

* All internal and public classes, methods, and properties should include a `/// <summary>` comment 
  * Add `<param>` and `<returns>` when applicable
  * **Example**:
    ``` C#
    /// <summary>
    /// Runs the TemplateAnalyzer logic given the template and parameters passed to it
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="template">The ARM Template <c>JSON</c>. Must follow this schema: https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#</param>
    /// <param name="parameters">The parameters for the ARM Template <c>JSON</c></param>
    /// <returns>List of TemplateAnalyzer results</returns>
    public static IEnumerable<IResult> Run(string template, string parameters = null)
    {
        â€¦
    }
    ```
#### Tests
High test code coverage is required to contribute to this project. This ensures the highest code quality. At least **80% test code coverage is required.** This project uses Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting for its tests. 
Please follow the below conventions when contributing to this project.
* Each .NET project should have its corresponding test project
* Each class should have its corresponding test class
* Each internal and public function in the class should be tested in the unit test class
* Follow the below naming conventions:
  * Test Project: *{project name}.(Unit/Functional)Tests* selecting the appropriate type of tests found in the project

  * Test methods:
    * (Data)TestMethod: `{method name}_{what is being tested}_{expected outcome}`
    * DataRow (display name): Short description that clearly differentiate between the DataRows
